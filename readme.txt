The scene may take a bit to load, there are several large files being rendered. The wireframe will slow it down.

The levels of hierachy are first there is group called "head" which contains my head and halo.
Then there is"abtHead" my scan is the parent of that group with the planets being children.
Earth is the head of the "abtEarth" group which the moon is within.
The moon is the head of the "abtMoon" group which the Satellite is in.
Jupiter is the head of "abtJupiter" with Io and Europa orbiting it.
Saturn is the head of the "abtSaturn" group which includes its ring.

sorry about saturn...

update 4/9/2020: Thanks for letting me update my code! The animation section was reduced from 50 lines to 20 lines.
